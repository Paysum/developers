## Authorization header

Paysum's API uses the Authorization header for your API Key. must send your API key via the Authorization header, or requests will be rejected.

```
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Your API key can be accessed and re-generated [in the security tab](https://paysum.io/dashboard/api-keys).

## Why did my API key change?

Paysum partners with GitHub to scan for leaked API keys. If you accidentally leak your Paysum API Key on GitHub, we will automatically reset your API key.

Simply use the new API key and don't publish to GitHub this time, use a `.gitignore` file and `.env` file.
